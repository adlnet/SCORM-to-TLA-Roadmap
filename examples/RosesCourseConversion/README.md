Roses SCORM Course Conversion Examples
======================================
This project contains 4 SCORM courses all using identical "Roses" content.  Two courses are regular SCORM courses and two are SCORM courses updated to automatically track xAPI statements.  The converted courses use the [SCORM to xAPI Wrapper files](https://github.com/adlnet/SCORM-to-xAPI-Wrapper).

The courses translate the SCORM Data Model to xAPI as defined in the [Experience API SCORM Profile](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-SCORM-Profile).  This document is in draft form. 

For detailed technical information on xAPI, [read the Experience API Spec](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md)
